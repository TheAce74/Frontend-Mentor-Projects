### What I learned

Phew üòå, I learnt a ton of new stuff and mostly on accessibility. Without further ado:

```html
aria-labelledby
aria-controls
aria-expanded
aria-live
```

```css
.never-thought-of-this-before {
  ul[role="list"],
  ol[role="list"] {
    list-style: none;
  }
}
The selector above opened my mind to more emmet capabilities as wellüòâ

The "columns" property as well, though I didn't use it
```

```js
Nothing to see here...
Though I had fun playing around with yet another libraryüòÅ
```

I'm still working on my custom scheme, the BEM doesn't really sit right with me for minor projects like this
