## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

```
Didn't really learn anything new but I got to use some stuff for the first time like
before(), replaceChild(), Array.from() and some others that for some reason I can't remember.

This is my favorite project, I did a lot of stuff I didn't know I could do before. It really broadened my view on certain things, and heightened my imagination and logic

Just so you know, when you use Array.from on HTML live collections, the array elements keep reference to their corresponding DOM predecessors; and the event object is writable-ish.

Oh and I added a little validation for your viewing pleasure üòè

One more thing, my deepest apologies to those that would want to learn from this project, I know that my approach was a teensy bit overkill üòÖ
